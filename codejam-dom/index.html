				<h2>Travelling</h2>
				<p>
					Almost all people are fond of travelling. It is very interesting to see new places, another towns and countries. 
					People may travel either for pleasure or on business. There are various means of travelling. For me there is 
					nothing like travel by air; it is more comfortable, more convenient and, of course, far quicker than any other 
					means. There is none of the dust and dirt of a railway or car journey, none of the trouble of changing from 
					train to steamer and then to another train.
				</p>
				<p>
						With a train you have speed, comfort and pleasure combined. From the comfortable seat of a railway carriage you 
						have a splendid view of the whole countryside. If you are hungry, you can have a meal in the dining-car; 
						and if a journey is a long one you can have a wonderful bed in a sleeper.
				</p>
				<p>
						Travelling by ship is also very popular now. It is very pleasant to feel the deck of the ship under the feet, to see 
						the rise and fall of the waves, to feel the fresh sea wind blowing in the face and hear the cry of the seagulls.
				</p>
				<p>
						Many people like to travel by car. It is interesting too, because you can see many sights in a short time,
						 you can stop when and where you like, you do not have to buy tickets or carry your suitcases.
				</p>
				<p>
						A very popular means of travelling is hiking. It is travelling on foot. Walking tours are very interesting. 
						Hitch-hiking is a very popular method of travelling among young people. But it is not as popular in our country as abroad.
